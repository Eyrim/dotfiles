# dotfiles

This is my home-grown home-manager-at-home easy solution.

Not every system will have home-manager. And I won't always want the overhead of installing it and such.

This repo contains the dotfiles I use on a daily basis, as well as coming packaged with an install script that does some manual setup. I.E.
* Symlink ./.zshrc to ~/.zshrc
* The same for my scripts
